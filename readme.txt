== Description ==

**Get the right ID for your products when syncing them from WooCommerce to Meta (Facebook and Instagram)**
 
There is a big issue with the plugin **Facebook for WooCommerce**. The ID of the products are given a fake ID for *content_ids* consisting of the product’s SKU and the product ID combined with an underscrore between them, for example *SKU123_321*, where *SKU123* is the SKU and *321* is the product ID. This becomes a problem with data tracking since the fake ID doesn’t really exist on the site.

What this plugin does is, it lets you choose if you want to use the SKU or the product ID to identify your products when syncing to Facebook and Instagram with the Meta Pixel.
